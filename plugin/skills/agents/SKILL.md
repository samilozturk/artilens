# Agent View

1. Run `artilens session agents --data .claude/artilens/agents.data.json`.
2. Relay the CLI's summary line to the user verbatim.
3. Start a background subagent with the Agent tool: `subagent_type: general-purpose`, `model: sonnet`, `run_in_background: true`. Prompt template:
   "Read `<absolute path to agents.data.json>` and `<this skill's base dir>/../../references/artifact-authoring.md`. Load the artifact-design skill, then author and publish an artifact with the Artifact tool.
   Page plan: timeline of which subagent did what and when; a task/result summary table. Copy-as-prompt is optional — only include it if the JSON has editable state worth capturing.
   All visual design decisions are yours."
4. Continue your own task. When the subagent finishes, relay the artifact URL to the user.

If hook event logging is enabled, the data JSON includes richer SubagentStart/SubagentStop and Task events.
