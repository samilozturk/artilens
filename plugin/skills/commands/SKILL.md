# Commands Catalog

1. Run `artilens session commands --data .claude/artilens/commands.data.json`.
2. Relay the CLI's summary line to the user verbatim.
3. Start a background subagent with the Agent tool: `subagent_type: general-purpose`, `model: sonnet`, `run_in_background: true`. Prompt template:
   "Read `<absolute path to commands.data.json>` and `<this skill's base dir>/../../references/artifact-authoring.md`. Load the artifact-design skill, then author and publish an artifact with the Artifact tool.
   Page plan: catalog of available commands/skills; contextual recommendations with reasons.
   All visual design decisions are yours."
4. Continue your own task. When the subagent finishes, mention the top contextual recommendations (with reason) and relay the artifact URL.
